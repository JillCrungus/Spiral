# Spiral
Spiral is a Danganronpa Modding Framework written in Java

The latest release can be found here: https://github.com/UnderMybrella/Spiral/releases/latest

# Usage
Double click the JAR file, and it brings up a launcher. Fancy, isn't it?

You'll need to specify the game you're using first, through the "Settings" button.

# Mods
Mods are basically .zip files renamed to .drs, and are put in a 'mods' folder.

Include a mod.info file with the format of:


Mod Name

Author Name

Description


Any files included in the .dr1 file will be included in the repacked .wad

NOTE: Installing mods requres at least 3.5 GB of harddrive space reserved for the extraction, however this folder is deleted after use.

Installing mods takes around 1 to 1 and a half minutes.

# Patreon
I do this work entirely in my spare time, and it's not always easy. While I enjoy doing it, it does take up a bunch of time.

As such, I've set up a Patreon page, if people want to support me, which can be found here: https://www.patreon.com/undermybrella

Please note: The Patreon page is entirely optional, and I won't stop my projects if nobody donates. However, it would be nice, as projects like this really do suck up a lot of time.
