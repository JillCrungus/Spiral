# Spiral
Spiral is a Danganronpa Modding Framework written in Kotlin, which is currently undergoing a major rewrite. Watch this space for any updates which may or may not happen, but stay tuned!

# Usage
Right now, the SPIRAL indev release is a **command line only program**. That means, you need to open it using either Command Prompt, or Terminal, depending on your operating system.

Open your Command Prompt or Terminal, and type in "java -jar ", and then drag in the JAR file downloaded from the Releases page. This will either start up SPIRAL or inform you that you need to install Java.

Currently, the feature set of SPIRAL is fairly limited - supporting extraction and conversion only. A full list of commands is available in the program, however for convenience a simple list is provided here
* help
* find
* registered
* convert
* operate
* exit

If you discover a bug, please report it!

# Patreon (Also known as yes you can stop reading)
I do this work entirely in my spare time (Shocking, right). And considering the scope of this project and others, it'd be nice if you spare a dollar or two every month. Nothing big, really. On the offchance that you're interested, details can be found here: https://www.patreon.com/undermybrella

Note the usual of it's a side thing I won't stop if I don't receive money etc etc etc whatever. You probably know the drill from everywhere else by now.
