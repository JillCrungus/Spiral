# Spiral
Spiral is a Danganronpa Modding Framework written in Kotlin, which is currently undergoing a major rewrite. Watch this space for any updates which may or may not happen, but stay tuned!

At the moment the only way you'll be able to use this is by actually coding an extension, so trust me; it's not usable.

# Patreon (Also known as yes you can stop reading)
I do this work entirely in my spare time (Shocking, right). And considering the scope of this project and others, it'd be nice if you spare a dollar or two every month. Nothing big, really. On the offchance that you're interested, details can be found here: https://www.patreon.com/undermybrella

Note the usual of it's a side thing I won't stop if I don't receive money etc etc etc whatever. You probably know the drill from everywhere else by now.
